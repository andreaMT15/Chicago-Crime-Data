        <p>The purpose of this project is to quantitatively display crime trends for Chicago.</p>
        <p>Most of the data compares the previous five years, however we gathered data dating back to 2001 for some of
            our statistics.</p>
        <p>Data is filtered by neighborhoods as well as types with theft, battery, narcotics, assault and burglary
            being the most common.</p>
        <p>All data used is from the City of Chicagoâ€™s data portal, where they update every seven days.</p>
        <p>Find your neighborhood and see how its developed and how it compares to surrounding areas.</p>
